These materials accompany the book <a href="https://nostarch.com/math-security">"Math for Security"</a>. Each folder represents one of the project chapters. In it you will find the notebooks referenced in the text as well as the example data. For large data sets (such as the facial recognition data) the files are stored in the DAta directory as compressed files. The files themselves were uploaded using git Large File System (LFS). You can install git LFS by following <A href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage">this guide</a>. Once installed you can pull down the large files with the command 

    git lfs pull

* This code was largely written and tested on Linux, more than a year ago. I've made every effort to test the code against Windows and MacOS, but there may have been changes to dependencies or underlying system's which cause issues. If you're having trouble running a project and can't find a solution, create a GitHub issue and I will do my best to assist you.
